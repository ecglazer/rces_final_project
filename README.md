## Final Project Proposal: Crevasses on George VI Ice Shelf
Emily Glazer

#### Scientific question:

In this project, I would like to investigate crevasses in the George VI ice shelf (GVIIS), one of the fastest melting ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula. More specifically, I plan to look at the relationship between basal crevasses and ice surface features.

My goal will be to answer the questions: what is the distribution and scale of basal crevasses on GVIIS, and how does this relate to the overlying surface features (including surface crevasses)?

#### Links to relevant datasets:

- Radar data to examine basal crevasses: [CReSIS: Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets](https://data.cresis.ku.edu/)
- Satellite data to examine surface features: [ICESat-2: Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2](https://icesat-2.gsfc.nasa.gov/)


#### Summary of analysis:

I plan to first read the CReSIS radar data into Python XArray datasets, and subset the flight lines by location to determine the distribution of data over GVIIS. I will then choose a representative sample of ~4 radar profiles, ideally 2 near grounding lines and 2 near the center of the ice shelf, and/or 2 with significant basal crevassing and 2 without, and plot the echograms next to the corresponding IceSAT-2 elevation data to see surface features in that location. I will examine the side-by-side profiles to see if there is a relationship worth further investigation between basal crevassing and surface features such as surface crevasses, rifts, or ponding.# rces_final_project
